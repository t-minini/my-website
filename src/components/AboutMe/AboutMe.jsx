            "Hello, my name is Tulio Minini, a former interior designer who
            discovered his passion for web development. <br />
            <br />
            In August 2022, I graduated from a full-time intensive Full-stack
            Web Development Bootcamp of nine weeks (360 hours) at Ironhack SÃ£o
            Paulo. <br />
            <br />I feel excited about building functional AND beautiful things,
            love working in teams, sharing knowledge, and delivering projects
            that require thoroughness and patience. I firmly believe that, in
            the work environment, we need to feel safe and encouraged to learn,
            explore and share experiences to help the company's growth and our
            own. <br />
            <br />I have a small vinyl collection, which keeps growing. I love
            cats, travelling, and attending concerts, and I am a big fan of Star
            Wars AND Star Trek (both are amazing). I feel comfortable, happy and
            safe when surrounded by kind and good-hearted people who want to
            make the world a better place."
